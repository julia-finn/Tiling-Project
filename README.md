# Tiling-Project
Consider the problem of laying out the floor of a square piazza with an artfully located fountain. For this problem, the area of the piazza can be viewed as a grid of dimensions 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, 16x16 etc. as long as the sides are a power of 2. We'll reserve a spot for the fountain with one black square tile placed at a randomly chosen row and column of the grid. The rest of the piazza can be perfectly tiled with L-shaped tiles.
Assume that you have an unlimited supply of randomly colored L-shaped tiles. An L-shaped tile takes up 3 square positions. In the 4x4 case on the left, there are 4 x 4 = 16 total positions. If we leave out the black tile marking the fountain at row=0, column=1, 15 positions remain, and these can be perfectly covered with 5 L-shaped tiles. In the middle there are 8 x 8 = 64 positions. Leaving out the black tile, 63 squares remain and these can be perfectly covered with 21 L-shaped tiles. On the right there are 64 x 64 = 4096 positions. Leaving out the (tiny) black tile, 4095 squares remain, and these can be perfectly covered with 1,365 L-shaped tiles.
